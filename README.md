# qchemtutorial
A brief tutorial for basic quantum chemistry calculations in Q-Chem and QCMagic.

## Compilation
The required packages and libraries should be obvious from the preamble. But in particular:
  * `biber` is required to compile the References.
 
`texlive 2019` as-is should contain all of the required packages and libraries. The latest packages updated via `MiKTeX` by July 2019 should do the job too.

## Using the tutorial
Adobe Reader is recommended to view the tutorial: line numbers in listings and command prompts are properly avoided when copying code and command snippets.
