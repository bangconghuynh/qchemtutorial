# qchemtutorial
A brief tutorial for basic quantum chemistry calculations in Q-Chem and QCMagic.

## Compilation
The required packages and libraries should be obvious from the preamble. But in particular:
  * `biber` is required to compile the References;
  * The font `Alegreya` is required. They can be downloaded from [here](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Alegreya). More information on how to use `Alegreya` in math mode can be found [here](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/422854/problems-with-using-numbers-and-italic-greek-of-alegreya-font-in-math-mode).
 
`texlive 2019` as-is should contain all of the required packages and libraries. The latest packages updated via `MiKTeX` by July 2019 should do the job too.

## Using the tutorial
Adobe Reader is recommended to view the tutorial: line numbers in listings and command prompts are properly avoided when copying code and command snippets.
